# ![Îµpsilon](logo.png)

Epsilon is a scanner generator.

It converts a sequence of regular expressions into a
[deterministic finite automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton).
The DFA accepts input that matches any of these expressions.
Each expression is associated with a token.
The generated scanner applies the DFA repeatedly to input text to 
return a sequence of tokens.

Scanners may be generated for a variety of target languages, including
- Dot (for visualisations)
- Python

Epsilon is currently under heavy development.
It is usable, but probably contains bugs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.6 or later.

### Installing

Epsilon uses [Setuptools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuptools).

To build and install:
```sh
python3 setup.py build
python3 setup.py install
```

You may wish to install under your user account instead
```sh
python3 setup.py install --user
```

### Using

Please see the [epsilon manual](MANUAL.md).
